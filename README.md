## Table of Content

This repository focuses on data structures and algorithms essential for computer programming. Data structures organize data in memory or on disk, while algorithms manipulate this data.

Every computer program, even simple ones like address label printing, uses data structures and algorithms. For example, an array stores addresses, and a for loop accesses and prints each address.

This repository aims to help developers effectively solve common problems with Java code examples. Understanding these techniques is crucial for leveraging computing power to solve complex problems in today's fast-paced computer world.
